# FinSetAI — AI Billing & Settlement Infrastructure

## What is FinSetAI?
FinSetAI is a billing and settlement infrastructure for AI applications. It solves the fundamental problem that developers can't easily bill users for AI inference costs.

## Core Innovation: Atomic 4-Party Settlement
Every AI transaction involves four parties: User, Developer/App, AI Provider, and FinSetAI. Our protocol settles all four simultaneously — atomically — in one operation. All or nothing.

## Key Features
- **Prepaid Wallets**: Users fund wallets with a cost cap. Bank account never connected to variable AI costs.
- **Universal Output Unit (UOU)**: $0.001 per unit. Normalizes pricing across all AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Whisper, Gemini).
- **Developer Margins**: 0–100% markup. Fixed price mode available. Your app, your economics.
- **Hash Ledger**: Immutable audit trail for every transaction. EU AI Act compliance by architecture.
- **Trust Fund**: 5% reserve for dispute resolution and user protection.
